## Data and packages

Again, we will load all of the `{tidyverse}` for this Activity.

```{r load_packages, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

We continue our exploration of college majors and earnings from the data behind the FiveThirtyEight story [The Economic Guide To Picking A College Major](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/).
Remember that there are many considerations that go into picking a major.
Earning potential and employment prospects are two (important) of these considerations, but they do not tell the entire story.

We read in the same data from Activity 4 below, but notice that this code is now surrounded in parentheses.

```{r load_data, message=FALSE}
(college_recent_grads <- read_csv("data/recent-grads.csv"))
```

Compare this code output to the `load_data` chunk in your knitted Activity 4 `.md` report.
What does enclosing an assignment code (i.e., `object_name <- r_code`) in parentheses do?

**Response**: Shows the output for that variable


### Data Codebook

Descriptions of the variables are again provided below.
Again note that the ACS only asks [one question](https://www.census.gov/acs/www/about/why-we-ask-each-question/sex/) about a person's sexual identity.

- Do women tend to choose majors with lower or higher earnings?

## Analysis

### Median Earnings Description

### Median ... Median Earnings 

For the rest of this semester, I will no longer provide you with R code chunks.
Have no fear!
There are a number of ways to create a code chunk:

- Tired: Copy-and-paste a previous code chunk, delete the code, then add your new code
- Wired: Click on the ![new chunk icon](README-img/new-chunk-icon.png) and select ![r chunk icon](README-img/r-chunk-icon.png) (notice all the different types of code chunks that you can use within an RMarkdown file!)
- Inspired: Ctrl/Command + Alt/Option + I

Below, create a code chunk and name it `median_earnings`.
Make sure there is an empty line above and below the code chunk.

```{r median_earnings}
college_recent_grads %>%
  summarise(median(median))
```


In your newly created R code chunk, verify that the median income for all majors was $36,000.
Using the `college_recent_grads` dataset and functions from `{dplyr}`, verify the *median* summary statistic for the variable median earnings of full-time, year-round workers (`median`).
Name this numerical summary `median_all_majors`.

![](README-img/noun_pause.png) **Planned Pause Point**: If you have any questions, contact your instructor. Otherwise feel free to continue on.

### Additional Summaries of Median Earnings

Often we would like more information than the median to help us to better understand the distribution of a variable.
Using the `college_recent_grads` dataset and functions from `{dplyr}`, obtain the sample size (i.e., *n*umber of observations), *mean*, *s*tandard *d*eviation, *min*imum, *median*, and *max*imum summaries for the variable `median` earnings of full-time, year-round workers.
Be careful when you name your output summaries as we are dealing with things that could use the same name (i.e., "median").
When I and obtaining numerical summaries for variables, I like to include the variable name in my summary name (e.g., `mean_med_earnings = mean(median)`).
Create a code chunk and name it `summary_earnings`.

```{r summary_earnings}
college_recent_grads %>%
  summarise(n=n(),mean_med_earnins=mean(median),st_dev=sd(median),min=min(median),median=median(median),max=max(median))
```


Provide a discussion on what you believe the distribution of median earnings will look like.
You should discuss the center, spread, and potential shape only using these values - I do NOT want to see any data visualizations here.

**Response**: Because the mean is greater than the median, I expect the shape to be skewed right.


### Median Earnings by Major Category

Now we will see how the different major categories compare to the overall distribution of median earnings.
Using the `college_recent_grads` dataset and functions from `{dplyr}`, obtain similar summaries of the variable `median` earnings of full-time, year-round workers as your `summary_earnings` code chunk, *by* for each `major_category`.
*Arrange* this summary table by the median earning.
Create a code chunk and name it `major_earnings`.

```{r major_earnings}
college_recent_grads %>% 
  group_by(major_category) %>% 
  summarise(n=n(),mean=mean(employed_fulltime_yearround),st_dev=sd(employed_fulltime_yearround),min=min(employed_fulltime_yearround),median=median(employed_fulltime_yearround),max=max(employed_fulltime_yearround)) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```


Provide a discussion on how each major compares to the overall distribution.
You should discuss the center, spread, and potential shape only using these summary values - I do NOT want to see any data visualizations here.

**Response**: Business, Communications & Journalism are the only majors that have a higher mean of the median. Also, for every major, the mean is greater than the median. So, just as with the total of all majors, we can expect them to be right skewed.


Before we continue, add the following to the end of your pipeline (you will need to pipe first) in your `major_earnings` code chunk:

```
knitr::kable()
```

Knit your document with and without this last piped code.
What changes about the output?
When would this `knitr::kable` code be useful?

**Response**: Makes the data frame into a nice table


![](README-img/noun_pause.png) **Planned Pause Point**: If you have any questions, contact your instructor. Otherwise feel free to continue on.

### Visualize Median Earnings by Major Category

Let us see how well your descriptions in the [Median Earnings by Major Category](#median-earnings-by-major-category) section compare to the actual distributions.
Plot the distribution of the variable `median` earnings of full-time, year-round workers for each `major_category` using the *boxplot* and *jitter* geometries.
Create a code chunk and name it `major_boxplot`.

```{r major_boxplot}
ggplot(data=college_recent_grads, aes(x=major_category,y=median))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  geom_jitter()
```


Provide a discussion on how your descriptions in the Median Earnings by Major Category section compares.

**Response**: So this graph is really messy, but it does appear that some of the Major Categories are right skewed, however, there also appear to be some left skewed ones.



<img src="README-img/noun_pause.png" alt="pause" width = "20"/> <b>Planned Pause Point</b>: If you feel that you have a good understanding of these commands, feel free to start working on your project. The remainder of this activity will help to expand these commands.

### Multiple Rankings

#### Ranking by `major_category`

The current rankings provided in the data are by `major`.
Here we will develop a series of rankings to see how the `major_category` levels perform.
Create a code chunk and name it `category_rankings`.
In this code chunk, 

1. Group `college_recent_grads` by `major_category`
2. Summarize the variable `total` as the *sum* across all majors (to get the total number of majors within a `major_category`) and the following variables by their *median* value: `sharewomen`, `unemployment_rate`, and `median` earnings. Provide a meaningful name to each summarized value.
3. Assign/create a *rank* for each summarized value (rank for `total`, rank for `sharewomen`, etc.) and provide a meaningful name to each ranked column value.
4. Arrange the results so that `major_category` appear in alphabetical order ("A" at the top).

```{r category_rankings}
college_recent_grads %>% 
  group_by(major_category) %>% 
  summarise(total_sum=sum(total),med_sharewomen=median(sharewomen), med_unemploy=median(unemployment_rate), med_median=median(median)) %>% 
  mutate(ranked_total=min_rank(total_sum),ranked_sharewomen=min_rank(med_sharewomen),ranked_unemployment=min_rank(med_unemploy),ranked_median=min_rank(med_median)) %>% 
  arrange(major_category) %>% 
  select(major_category,ranked_total,ranked_sharewomen,ranked_unemployment,ranked_median)
```


Provide a discussion on how the `major_category` rankings compare.

**Response**: The Major with the lowest share of women is engineering, and it also has some of the highest pay. Conversely, Psychology has the highest share of women, and has the lowest median pay.


![](README-img/noun_pause.png) **(Final) Planned Pause Point**: If you have any questions, contact your instructor. Otherwise feel free to continue on.


Knit, then stage everything listed in your **Git** pane, commit (with a meaningful commit message), and push  to your GitHub repo.
Go to GitHub and verify that your `activity04-data-pieplines.Rmd` file appears as you intended it to.

You can now go back to the `README` file.
